The Arc launches ignited ion particles which cause an electrical discharge on impact. This compromises ship systems and is especially effective for depleting shields, while also inflicting considerable hull damage to unshielded targets. The turret variant has been praised as useful for civilian ships, which don't aim to destroy attackers but attempt to shake them off. Arc weaponry was developed and cleared for field use by the Royal Boron Military Defence, but is still considered somewhat experimental.","weapons_lasers",{"class":178},"bullet_bor_s_arc_01_mk1_macro",{"overheat":180,"cooldelay":12,"coolrate":181,"reenable":182},10000,2000,9500,{"max":184},100,{"max":186},200,{"max":188,"hittable":37},500,{"primary":190},true,{"hackable":190},{"activation":193,"deactivation":195},{"ref":194},"activate_wpn_gen",{"ref":196},"deactivate_wpn_gen",[],"/extensions\\ego_dlc_boron/assets/props/weaponsystems/boron/macros/weapon_bor_s_arc_01_mk1_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
