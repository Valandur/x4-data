Similar to other high precision weapons, the Meson Stream does not automatically track its target, and relies on the pilot's skill for aiming. In other respects, including its moderate range, it handles more similarly to beam weapons such as the Beam Emitter. The Meson Stream does not require charging, and can theoretically be fired without releasing the trigger. However, the ship's maximum heat capacity will usually prevent this kind of usage. Because of the weapon's extreme power consumption and heat generation, it can only be attached to high-energy weapon mounts.\\n\\nFor a variety of reasons, the Terran military had long since toyed with the idea of an oversized laser cannon. Despite requiring an entirely new, specialised platform, and bearing an abysmally wasteful energy profile, such a weapon's potential as a deterrent was never in question. Moreover, superweapons maintain a special place in the heart of Terran popular culture, and when the time came to develop the first small-scale prototype, there was overwhelming public support for the project. In light of this, the Meson Stream represented the first cautious, yet determined, steps of the Terran Protectorate towards fulfilling a long-harboured fantasy.\\n\\nIn return for massively increased material cost, the Mk2 variant manages to raise the energy output of the weapon to an even higher level.","weapons_lasers",{"class":192},"bullet_ter_m_beam_01_mk2_macro",{"overheat":194,"cooldelay":195,"coolrate":196,"reenable":197},10000,0.13,500,2000,{"max":13},{"max":13},{"max":201,"hittable":13},1000,{"firing":203,"activation":206,"deactivation":208},{"start":204,"stop":205},"startshooting_ter_m_beam_01_mk1","stopshooting_ter_m_beam_01_mk1",{"ref":207},"activate_wpn_gen",{"ref":209},"deactivate_wpn_gen",{"primary":211},true,{"hackable":211},[],"/ego_dlc_terran/assets/props/weaponsystems/highpower/macros/weapon_ter_m_beam_01_mk2_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
