S Pulse Laser Mk1","Pulse Laser","terran","Although it bears the same name as the most widely available weapon in the Jump Gate network, the Terran Pulse Laser functions in a slightly different way. It dispenses with the use of clips for short bursts, and puts a greater emphasis on the power of the individual projectiles. Despite the weapon's reduced effective range, the microscopic particles are accelerated faster and reach their targets much quicker. Heat, therefore, accumulates more quickly than for its non-Terran counterpart, but because of the supreme energy efficiency of the underlying mechanism, overheating remains an unlikely event. As such, pilots who use this version of the Pulse Laser are still rewarded for maintaining pressure on their opponents, and remaining on target for the entirety of the fight.\\n\\nAfter the Realignment, the Terran Protectorate was quick to survey the military capabilities of its potential rivals in the new Jump Gate network, and soon acquired blueprints for the most widespread weapon of the time - the Pulse Laser. Noticing its versatility and beautiful simplicity, the well-oiled machine of the Terran military-industrial complex did what it had always done best: made extensive adjustments to auspicious technology to give it a distinct Terran identity and to prevent reverse-engineering. The result still behaves like a Pulse Laser in practice. Although initially it was deemed unusable by foreign powers, defying all predictions, the Pulse Laser has been retrofitted onto many other ships with only minimal compromise.\\n\\nThe Mk2 variant greatly improves the weapon's energy output and rate of fire, while only marginally raising its rate of heat accumulation.","weapons_lasers",{"class":286},"bullet_ter_s_laser_01_mk1_macro",{"overheat":288,"cooldelay":289,"coolrate":290,"reenable":291},10000,1.13,2000,9500,{"max":293},160,{"max":295},320,{"max":297,"hittable":13},500,{"primary":299},true,{"hackable":299},{"activation":302,"deactivation":304},{"ref":303},"activate_wpn_gen",{"ref":305},"deactivate_wpn_gen",[],"/ego_dlc_terran/assets/props/weaponsystems/standard/macros/weapon_ter_s_laser_01_mk1_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
