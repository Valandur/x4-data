Its pin-point accuracy and high projectile speed make it an excellent choice for fighting small and fast targets, handling fragile lockboxes, and for dealing with deployables like mines and lasertowers. Often initially scoffed at for its comparatively low damage output, its slow heat generation and sublime cooling result in a steady stream of disruptive fire, which in turn rewards pilots who can stay on target for an extended period. Faced with larger enemies, the Pulse Laser does not become obsolete as quickly as one might expect. Used in greater numbers, it can still be a formidable choice against frigates and corvettes, though an upgrade to a larger weapon mount may be advisable to maintain a level playing field. The Pulse Laser remains the preferred choice of commanders who favour versatility over optimisation against specific opponents, or who have little trust in the aim of their subordinates.\\n\\nThe technology behind the Pulse Laser is advanced and efficient. Within a shielded chamber, microscopic fragments of matter are superheated and accelerated by a pulsed neodymium laser. The weapon was originally designed by the Ministry of Finance to provide a robust loadout for their escort fleets, without having to invest time and resources into the maintenance of a well-rounded combined arms setup. Over time, and thanks to the Teladi Company's aggressive marketing, it has been adopted as the number one weapon of convenience by all other former members of the Community of Planets.\\n\\nThe Mk2 variant sports a slightly longer burst. This lowers the efficiency of the heat dissipation between bursts and thereby exponentially drives up the cost of the internal shielding, but results in an overall higher damage output.","weapons_lasers",{"class":23},"bullet_gen_s_laser_01_mk1_macro",{"overheat":25,"cooldelay":26,"coolrate":27,"reenable":28},10000,1.13,2000,9500,{"max":30},180,{"max":32},360,"",{"integrated":11},{"primary":36},true,{"hackable":36},{"activation":39,"deactivation":41},{"ref":40},"activate_wpn_gen",{"ref":42},"deactivate_wpn_gen",[],"/assets/props/weaponsystems/standard/macros/weapon_gen_xs_laser_01_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
