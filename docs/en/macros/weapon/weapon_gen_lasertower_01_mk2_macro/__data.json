It discharges high-velocity beams which hit their target almost immediately. However, somewhat counterintuitively, it achieves this instantaneous accuracy by restraining the energy that the beam puts out. Since the beam is not as intense as the projectiles fired by many of its contemporaries, it only inflicts damage gradually, which exposes the pilot to a counter-attack. Because of this, and the fact that the weapon inflicts more damage the nearer it is to its target, the Beam Emitter is mainly used on nimble fighters which are able to get up close and out-manoeuvre their target when necessary.\\n\\nThe Mk2 variant tries to rectify the weak damage output somewhat by ramping up the beam's intensity, but this comes at the cost of the weapon overheating more rapidly.","weapons_lasers",{"class":27},"bullet_gen_s_beam_01_mk2_macro",{"overheat":29,"cooldelay":30,"coolrate":31,"reenable":32},10000,1.13,2000,7500,"",{"max":35,"hittable":36},500,0,{"firing":38,"activation":41,"deactivation":43},{"start":39,"stop":40},"startshooting_gen_s_beam_01_mk1","stopshooting_gen_s_beam_01_mk1",{"ref":42},"activate_wpn_gen",{"ref":44},"deactivate_wpn_gen",{"firing":46},{"ref":47},"wpn_beam_gen_01",{"primary":49},true,{"hackable":49},[],"/assets/props/weaponsystems/standard/macros/weapon_gen_lasertower_01_mk2_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
