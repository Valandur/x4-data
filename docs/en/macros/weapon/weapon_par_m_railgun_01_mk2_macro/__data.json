M Mass Driver Mk2","Mass Driver","paranid","The Mass Driver fires a single high energy projectile, which maintains its accuracy and destructive force over a very long distance. Heat accumulates almost instantaneously when the trigger is engaged, after which the pilot can release the shot immediately or take their time to aim. These unique features come at a cost, however: the weapon is mounted in a fixed forward-facing orientation, which makes automatic target tracking impossible and means that the pilot has to rely solely on their own skill. Over an extended period of time, the energy output of this weapon may appear relatively poor, but its strength lies in the initial attack, which can surprise the target and take out vital systems before a skirmish. It is therefore most commonly used in a combined arms approach, to support an already engaged force. On fast and nimble ships, which can reliably keep their opponents at a distance, the weapon's superior range may also allow the pilot to defeat their opponent without ever coming under fire themselves.\\n\\nThis weapon is not to be confused with pre-Shutdown versions of the Mass Driver, which fired constant streams of shield-penetrating projectiles. The militaries of both the Argon Federation and the Godrealm of the Paranid attempted to improve on the old design, and both developed weapons that now bear little resemblance to the original. The Paranid opted for a dual barrel, lined with perfectly synchronised, superconductive electromagnets. It appears curious, therefore, that the weapons development experts in Trinity Sanctum, upon presenting what was essentially an entirely new type of weapon, chose to keep the traditional name.\\n\\nThe Mk2 variant incorporates expensive, highly calibrated electromagnets, greatly reducing the weapon's heat build-up before each shot.","weapons_lasers",{"class":239},"bullet_par_m_railgun_01_mk2_macro",{"overheat":241,"cooldelay":66,"coolrate":242,"reenable":243},10000,600,5000,{"max":13},{"max":13},{"max":247,"hittable":13},1001,{"factor":66,"time":249,"delay":38},0.15,{"primary":42},{"hackable":42},{"activation":253,"deactivation":255},{"ref":254},"activate_wpn_gen",{"ref":256},"deactivate_wpn_gen",[],"/assets/props/weaponsystems/heavy/macros/weapon_par_m_railgun_01_mk2_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
