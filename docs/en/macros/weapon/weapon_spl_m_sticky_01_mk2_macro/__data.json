After bypassing the shields, its projectiles stick to the target, applying damage over time. Most available variants fire short bursts interrupted by a long break, but the S Mk2 variant allows for nearly continuous fire with only a short break between clip changes. With only a slight damage advantage against shielded surface elements, the Thermal Disintegrator remains a solid choice for general use.\\n\\nThe Split developed this weapon after experimenting with shield penetration technologies. While the goal to bypass shields entirely was not achieved, the resulting suitability for general use, together with the additional benefit of partial bypass, make it a widely deployed weapon.\\n\\nThe Mk2 variant increases both damage and rate of fire.","weapons_lasers",{"class":190},"bullet_spl_m_sticky_01_mk2_macro",{"overheat":192,"cooldelay":193,"coolrate":194,"reenable":195},10000,1.13,2000,9500,{"max":197},106.4,{"max":199},212.8,{"max":201,"hittable":13},1001,{"primary":109},{"hackable":109},{"activation":205,"deactivation":207},{"ref":206},"activate_wpn_gen",{"ref":208},"deactivate_wpn_gen",[],"/ego_dlc_split/assets/props/weaponsystems/heavy/macros/weapon_spl_m_sticky_01_mk2_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
