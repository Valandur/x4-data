Its unusual handling requires the pilot to - as the name implies - manually charge every shot. It is recommended that it only be used when fully charged, as the damage potential is otherwise greatly reduced. Upon release, it fires multiple bolts, with a relatively small spread, which are able to stick to a target and deal damage over time. These bolts are sometimes deflected off the target entirely, resulting in them dealing little damage. If used correctly, the Muon Charger will never overheat, allowing for a continuous and consistent damage output.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Finance Science Division developed this weapon for all-round use, though arguably it can be difficult to deploy effectively in dogfights against fast targets. The ability to hold the charge and release at will was intended to give pilots more control over their weapon, and increase the fighter fleet's accuracy statistics. The unique characteristics of this weapon, however, mean that custom training is required, making it unsuitable for the Ministry's novice fighter program.\\n\\nThe Mk2 variant offers increased damage output.","weapons_lasers",{"class":217},"bullet_tel_s_charge_01_mk2_macro",{"overheat":219,"cooldelay":220,"coolrate":221,"reenable":222},10000,1.13,2000,7500,{"max":224},58,{"max":226},116,{"max":228,"hittable":13},500,{"firing":230},{"ref":231},"wpn_plasma_player_charging",{"factor":233,"time":16,"delay":234},1.1,0.05,{"primary":236},true,{"hackable":236},{"activation":239,"deactivation":241},{"ref":240},"activate_wpn_gen",{"ref":242},"deactivate_wpn_gen",[],"/assets/props/weaponsystems/heavy/macros/weapon_tel_s_charge_01_mk2_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
