To deliver its full damage potential, pilots are required to charge the weapon for a brief moment. The initial rapid heat generation nearly overheats the weapon, but it starts cooling down even if the pilot holds the shot instead of triggering it. This allows pilots to release a preloaded shot from the cooled-down weapon, enabling pilots to shoot twice. Attempting to shoot when the allowed heat generation would be exceeded, will trigger the safety mechanism, resulting in the Boson Lance overheating without firing. As an additional limitation, the weapon is static and requires pilots to turn their ship to aim, forgoing the automatic target tracking that is available on other weapons. The Boson Lance sees most use in fighting medium-sized ships, and when destroying the surface elements of capital ships.\\n\\nThe Boson Lance was invented relatively recently, by the Split brothers Ko t'Pa and Fyi t'Pa. With the reconnection of the Zyarth Patriarchy to the Commonwealth, the Patriarchy acquired its blueprint and refined it for mass production.\\n\\nThe most notable feature of the Mk2 variant is that it doubles the damage output.","weapons_lasers",{"class":199},"bullet_spl_s_railgun_01_mk2_macro",{"overheat":201,"cooldelay":58,"coolrate":202,"reenable":203},10000,600,1000,{"max":13},{"max":13},{"max":207,"hittable":13},500,{"firing":209},{"ref":210},"wpn_railgun_player_charging",{"primary":212},true,{"hackable":212},{"activation":215,"deactivation":217},{"ref":216},"activate_wpn_gen",{"ref":218},"deactivate_wpn_gen",[],"/ego_dlc_split/assets/props/weaponsystems/heavy/macros/weapon_spl_s_railgun_01_mk2_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
