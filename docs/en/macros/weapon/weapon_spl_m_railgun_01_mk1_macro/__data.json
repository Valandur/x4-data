Unlike other weapons, the Boson Lance forgoes automatic target tracking and is static, requiring the pilot to turn their ship to aim. This limitation results in the Boson Lance seeing most use in fighting medium-sized ships, or when destroying the surface elements of capital ships. In an attempt to mitigate this, some pilots who regularly use this weapon have developed rituals which they believe increase its damage output.\\n\\nThe Boson Lance was invented relatively recently, by the Split brothers Ko t'Pa and Fyi t'Pa. With the reconnection of the Zyarth Patriarchy to the Commonwealth, the Patriarchy acquired the weapon's blueprint and refined it for mass production.\\n\\nThe most notable feature of the Mk2 variant is that it doubles the damage output.","weapons_lasers",{"class":191},"bullet_spl_m_railgun_01_mk1_macro",{"overheat":193,"cooldelay":194,"coolrate":195,"reenable":196},10000,4,500,1000,{"max":13},{"max":13},{"max":200,"hittable":13},1001,{"primary":109},{"hackable":109},{"activation":204,"deactivation":206},{"ref":205},"activate_wpn_gen",{"ref":207},"deactivate_wpn_gen",[],"/extensions\\ego_dlc_split/assets/props/weaponsystems/heavy/macros/weapon_spl_m_railgun_01_mk1_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
