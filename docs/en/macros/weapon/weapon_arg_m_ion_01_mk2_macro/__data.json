M Ion Blaster Mk2","Ion Blaster","argon","This Argon weapon was designed to be an effective anti-shield measure, carried by small and medium-sized ships. While the electrically charged particles it dispenses will eat through a shield in a remarkably short time, the velocity of the projectile itself is not quite as impressive. For this reason, and the fact that the projectiles are not as damaging once the target's shields have dropped and the projectiles are hitting the ship's hull, the Ion Blaster is often used by the first wave of vanguard ships. It is also effective when used in combination with weapons that are more suited to penetrating the hull. The technology behind this weapon was developed by the Argon Navy's Research and Development team, in cooperation with Jinko-Tekina Technologies. Their goal was to replicate the Boron-made Ion weapon technology, to which the Argon had lost all access during the Jump Gate shutdown. Their success was mixed; although they managed to apply the technology to make Blasters suitable for small ships, their team struggled to develop something suitable for outfitting larger vessels.\\n\\nThe Mk2 variant offers a significant boost in damage against shields, but actually deals less damage to a ship's hull than the Mk1, making it an even more specialised weapon.","weapons_lasers",{"class":226},"bullet_arg_m_ion_01_mk2_macro",{"overheat":228,"cooldelay":229,"coolrate":230,"reenable":231},10000,1.13,2000,9500,{"max":233},73.6,{"max":235},174.2,{"max":237,"hittable":13},1001,{"firing":239,"activation":242,"deactivation":244},{"start":240,"stop":241},"startshooting_arg_s_ion_01_mk1","stopshooting_arg_s_ion_01_mk1",{"ref":243},"activate_wpn_gen",{"ref":245},"deactivate_wpn_gen",{"primary":247},true,{"hackable":247},[],"/assets/props/weaponsystems/energy/macros/weapon_arg_m_ion_01_mk2_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
