M Neutron Gatling Mk1","Neutron Gatling","split","The Split Neutron Gatling is a short range, rapid fire weapon comparable to the Bolt Repeater. Similar to the Bolt Repeater, the constant stream of projectiles travels rather slowly and requires aiming ahead in order to hit moving targets. The Neutron Gatling is renowned for its high damage output, but the low accuracy and noticeable spread can make hitting small targets at range rather challenging, forcing pilots to close the distance. For the dogfight-loving Split this is considered part of the hunt.\\n\\nThe Split developed this weapon, taking into account the psychological effects on the pilot and target. While the pilot feels empowered by commanding a high rate of fire over a prolonged time, the target feels terrorised by the light show and left to guess which projectiles might hit or miss. Despite not being part of the intended design, the low accuracy helps pirates to intimidate their prey without noticeably damaging their prize. It is a functional weapon for combat, but arguably also a tool to express the Split warrior culture and spread terror among their many foes.\\n\\nThe Mk2 variant offers increased damage output and a higher rate of fire.","weapons_lasers",{"class":265},"bullet_spl_m_gatling_01_mk1_macro",{"overheat":267,"cooldelay":268,"coolrate":269,"reenable":270},10000,1.13,2000,9500,{"max":272},70.8,{"max":274},141.6,{"max":276,"hittable":13},1001,{"firing":278,"activation":281,"deactivation":283},{"start":279,"stop":280},"startshooting_spl_s_gatling_01_mk1","stopshooting_spl_s_gatling_01_mk1",{"ref":282},"activate_wpn_gen",{"ref":284},"deactivate_wpn_gen",{"firing":286},{"ref":287},"spl_mg_firing",{"primary":51},{"hackable":51},[],"/extensions\\ego_dlc_split/assets/props/weaponsystems/heavy/macros/weapon_spl_m_gatling_01_mk1_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
