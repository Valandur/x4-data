The fired energy pulses, consisting of highly accelerated and polarised particles, prove effective against hull, while less so against shielded targets. This puts Phase weaponry in a unique position among the Boron arsenal, which otherwise tends towards primarily impairing shields and mobility. As a necessary last resort against undeterrable hostiles, Phase armaments are widely available as either weapons or turrets in various sizes, and form the backbone of Boron weaponry and fleet compositions.","weapons_lasers",{"class":198},"bullet_bor_s_laser_01_mk1_macro",{"overheat":200,"cooldelay":12,"coolrate":201,"reenable":202},10000,2000,9500,{"max":204},165,{"max":206},330,{"max":208,"hittable":42},500,{"primary":210},true,{"hackable":210},{"activation":213,"deactivation":215},{"ref":214},"activate_wpn_gen",{"ref":216},"deactivate_wpn_gen",[],"/ego_dlc_boron/assets/props/weaponsystems/boron/macros/weapon_bor_s_laser_01_mk1_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
