M Proton Barrage Mk1","Proton Barrage","terran","The Terran Proton Barrage is a short range weapon which can only be attached to high-energy weapon mounts. It is considered the Terran high-energy variant of the Commonwealth Bolt Repeater. Compared to the Bolt Repeater, the Proton Barrage offers higher damage output and projectile speed, but forfeits some of its range. While providing more damage in total, the Barrage has a lower fire rate and focusses on delivering more powerful individual projectiles during its long bursts. Its main downsides are its compatibility restriction that limits it to Terran ship designs, and the fact that it is twice as expensive when compared to the weaker Commonwealth Bolt Repeater. The Proton Barrage is a generalist weapon which performs well against most reasonable targets.\\n\\nWith the reconnection of the Commonwealth, the Terran Secret Service acquired the Bolt Repeater blueprint, enabling Terran engineers to develop it into the Proton Barrage. They adjusted it for Terran high-energy mount compatibility, effectively increasing its power, while also preventing the Commonwealth from using it.\\n\\nThe Mk2 variant increases the damage output, despite reducing the rate of fire, by making the individual projectiles more powerful still.","weapons_lasers",{"class":218},"bullet_ter_m_gatling_01_mk1_macro",{"overheat":220,"cooldelay":221,"coolrate":222,"reenable":223},10000,1.13,2000,9500,{"max":225},70,{"max":227},140,{"max":229,"hittable":13},1000,{"firing":231,"activation":234,"deactivation":236},{"start":232,"stop":233},"startshooting_ter_m_gatling_01_mk1","stopshooting_ter_m_gatling_01_mk1",{"ref":235},"activate_wpn_gen",{"ref":237},"deactivate_wpn_gen",{"primary":239},true,{"hackable":239},[],"/ego_dlc_terran/assets/props/weaponsystems/highpower/macros/weapon_ter_m_gatling_01_mk1_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
