L Ion Net Launcher Mk1","Ion Net Launcher","boron","The Ion Net Launcher is a utility armament developed by the Royal Boron Military Defence, a government research organisation known for their experimental engineering. The Net Launcher fires a burst of fast projectiles, which, independent of enemy contact, explode near their predetermined target position. Each explosion casts a wide net, impairing the mobility of ships caught within. While the nets can prove useful in simultaneously compromising multiple attackers, they are less so during tumultuous dogfights, as allied ships closely engaged with hostiles could be impaired along with their enemies. This makes a military application within some fleet compositions difficult, and civilian ships operating in remote systems lack the necessary interface to field such a large turret.","weapons_turrets",{"class":259},"bullet_bor_turret_l_disruptor_01_mk1_macro",{"max":261},25,{"max":263},80,{"rate":19,"time":265},0.5,{"max":267,"threshold":268,"integrated":13},2100,0.2,{"activation":270},{"ref":271},"",{"strength":273},1000,{"kill":275},{"faction":276,"boost":278},{"change":277},-0.0005,{"absolute":279,"decay":280,"delay":281},-1,0.02,540,[],"/ego_dlc_boron/assets/props/weaponsystems/boron/macros/turret_bor_l_disruptor_01_mk1_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
