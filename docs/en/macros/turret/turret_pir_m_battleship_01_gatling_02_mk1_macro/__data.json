M Turret","Turret","Erlking Turret","argon","The Erlking M Turret fires bursts of high speed projectiles, reminiscent of Bolt Repeater burst fire. While fixed weapons usually outperform their turret counterparts of the same size, the Erlking's turrets are an unusual exception; the damage from this turret is comparable to, and might even exceed, that of M Bolt Repeater weapons at close range. Over distance, however, the damage output falls off steeply, and at maximum range barely matches that of a standard M Bolt Repeater turret. Although the Erlking is perfectly capable of defending itself at a distance, the high damage output of its turrets at short range makes it much more dangerous at close proximity, meaning that aggressive manoeuvres by the Erlking's pilot are rewarded. This exceptional performance is attributed to the Erlking's power core, from which the turrets draw energy.\\n\\nBoso Ta was particularly keen to go into detail about how this turret manages to rapidly access the power core, for only the blink of an eye at a time, before just as rapidly cutting the connection, thereby preventing an energy draining feedback loop capable of destroying the ship. Boso Ta also said not to worry, as the safety mechanisms will prevent this from happening most of the time.","weapons_turrets",{"class":402},"bullet_pir_turret_m_battleship_01_gatling_01_mk1_macro",{"max":404},120.8,{"max":406},241.6,{"rate":16,"time":16},{"max":409,"threshold":410,"integrated":13},900,0.1,{"firing":412},{"ref":413},"turret_gatling_muzzle",{"activation":415},{"ref":18},{"strength":417},1000,{"kill":419},{"faction":420,"boost":422},{"change":421},-0.0005,{"absolute":84,"decay":423,"delay":424},0.02,540,[],"/ego_dlc_pirate/assets/props/weaponsystems/heavy/macros/turret_pir_m_battleship_01_gatling_02_mk1_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
