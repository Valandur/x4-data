They are best utilised, therefore, against less agile ships and emplacements that cannot easily avoid the impact simply by moving out of the way. The Light Torpedo missile is a hot-launched weapon. This means the rocket motor fires immediately upon button-press and begins its slow, ponderous journey towards the target. This in turn imparts significantly more stress and maintenance costs upon the launcher itself. With an enlarged launcher comes a larger body which allows significantly more room for explosive mass in the weapon. This torpedo is a two-stage weapon with a powerful high explosive precursor warhead that violently rips a hole in the enemy vessel. A primary charge then detonates and turns the weapon into a massive and extremely damaging fragmentation grenade, more than powerful enough to rip apart most ships in a single blow. The Light Torpedo missile is extremely resilient to countermeasures.","missiletypes",{"value":16},{"amount":16,"barrelamount":16,"lifetime":100,"range":101,"guided":16,"icon":102,"retarget":13,"tags":103},50,3000,"hud_ms_torpedo_light_mk1","torpedo",{"value":105},4791,{"time":107},10,{"max":109},8,{"explosion":111,"launch":113},{"ref":112},"missile_explosion_heavy_01",{"ref":114},"missile_torpedo_muzzle",{"system":103},{"resilience":117},0.996,{"inertia":119,"drag":121,"mass":125},{"pitch":120,"yaw":120,"roll":120},2.311,{"forward":122,"reverse":123,"horizontal":124,"vertical":124,"pitch":120,"yaw":120,"roll":120},0.575,2.299,7.472,4.421,[127],{"macro":128,"ref":88,"resolved":131},{"ref":129,"connection":130},"engine_missile_guided_mk1_macro","ship",{"class":132,"name":129,"component":133,"properties":140,"connections":172,"xmlSourceFile":173,"duplicates":174},"engine",{"class":132,"name":134,"connections":135,"xmlSourceFile":138,"duplicates":139},"generic_engine",[136],{"name":130,"tags":137,"optional":13},"component engine standard","/assets/props/engines/generic_engine.xml",[],{"identification":141,"thrust":144,"angular":18,"hull":149,"hack":150,"effects":151,"explosioneffect":162,"sounds":164,"throttle":167,"areadamage":170},{"hidden":16,"mk":16,"type":142,"surfaceelement":143},"enginetypes",true,{"forward":145,"reverse":13,"strafe":146,"pitch":147,"yaw":147,"roll":148},57.887,5,158.285,218.452,{"integrated":16},{"hackable":143},{"boosting":152,"explosion":154,"sefx_damage_medium":156,"sefx_damage_high":158,"sefx_damage_low":160},{"ref":153},"boostfx_engine_player_01",{"ref":155},"surfacemodule_explosion_generator",{"ref":157},"surfacemodule_engine_damage_m_medium",{"ref":159},"surfacemodule_engine_damage_m_high",{"ref":161},"surfacemodule_damage_m_low",{"strength":163},2001,{"highwayambient":165},{"ref":166},"engineambient_highway",{"increaserate":168,"decreaserate":169},2,3,{"value":171},200,[],"/assets/props/engines/macros/engine_missile_guided_mk1_macro.xml",[],"/assets/props/weaponsystems/missile/macros/missile_torpedo_light_mk1_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
