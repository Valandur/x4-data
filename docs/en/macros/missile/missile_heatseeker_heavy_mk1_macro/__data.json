During testing, a significant number of encounters resulted in mission failures that could have been prevented by fitting the missile with just a slightly more powerful warhead. Unfortunately, when the team brought this matter up, politics got in the way and what was intended to be a simple upgrade turned into a weapon so different that it became its own development program entirely.\\n\\nThis new Heavy Heatseeker weapon, nicknamed the Icarus, is a heat-seeking missile with a powerful warhead capable of dealing significant, possibly even catastrophic, damage to most fighters, heavy fighters and corvettes. While multiple impacts may be required to take out a frigate, the weapon is more than capable of that as well. It is not too agile though and like its smaller cousin, it suffers from the same design compromises on its guidance package, meaning it can be fairly easily defeated by decoys.","missiletypes",{"value":16},{"amount":16,"barrelamount":16,"lifetime":93,"range":94,"guided":16,"icon":95,"retarget":13,"tags":96},43.2,7000,"hud_ms_heatseeker_heavy_mk1","guided",{"value":98},3592,{"time":100},6,{"max":102},2,{"explosion":104,"launch":106},{"ref":105},"missile_explosion_medium_01",{"ref":107},"missile_guided_muzzle",{"system":109},"missile_guided",{"resilience":111},0.81,{"inertia":113,"drag":115,"mass":120},{"pitch":114,"yaw":114,"roll":114},1.611,{"forward":116,"reverse":117,"horizontal":118,"vertical":118,"pitch":119,"yaw":119,"roll":119},0.266,1.063,1.906,0.764,1.328,[122],{"macro":123,"ref":81,"resolved":126},{"ref":124,"connection":125},"engine_missile_guided_mk1_macro","ship",{"class":127,"name":124,"alias":-1,"component":128,"properties":135,"connections":156,"xmlSourceFile":157,"duplicates":158},"engine",{"class":127,"name":129,"alias":-1,"source":-1,"connections":130,"xmlSourceFile":133,"duplicates":134},"generic_engine",[131],{"name":125,"tags":132,"optional":13},"component engine standard","/assets/props/engines/generic_engine.xml",[],{"identification":136,"thrust":138,"angular":18,"hull":143,"hack":144,"effects":146,"sounds":149,"throttle":152,"areadamage":154},{"hidden":16,"mk":16,"type":137},"enginetypes",{"forward":139,"reverse":13,"strafe":140,"pitch":141,"yaw":141,"roll":142},57.887,5,158.285,218.452,{"integrated":16},{"hackable":145},true,{"boosting":147},{"ref":148},"boostfx_engine_player_01",{"highwayambient":150},{"ref":151},"engineambient_highway",{"increaserate":102,"decreaserate":153},3,{"value":155},200,[],"/assets/props/engines/macros/engine_missile_guided_mk1_macro.xml",[],"/assets/props/weaponsystems/missile/macros/missile_heatseeker_heavy_mk1_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
