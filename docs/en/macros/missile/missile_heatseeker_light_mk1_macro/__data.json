Given the often tightly choreographed Paranid approach to combat manoeuvres, and the frantic nature of dogfights in general, where split-second decisions and actions can have severe consequences, this targeting logic was deemed in accordance with the Holy Three-Dimensionality. Funding for its development was allocated, and what they got in return was a weapon that has virtually no lock-on time requirement whatsoever. That advantage, however, comes at a significant cost to threat-identification and countermeasure burn-through capability. In practice, this means that the weapon is easily foiled by decoys and best used either in massed volleys, often from multiple ships, or in drawn-out engagements in which the enemy's supply of countermeasures is depleted. Naturally, this sort of approach does not sit too well with a military that prides itself on efficiency.\\n\\nExactly how the blueprints for the Stormbolt found their way to the open markets is unknown, but while the weapon failed to gain traction with the Paranid, other races with a less frugal view on munitions expenditure have since made good use of it.","missiletypes",{"value":16},{"amount":16,"barrelamount":16,"lifetime":93,"range":94,"guided":16,"icon":95,"retarget":13,"tags":96},10,5000,"hud_ms_heatseeker_light_mk1","guided",{"value":98},698,{"time":100},2,{"max":16},{"explosion":103,"launch":105},{"ref":104},"missile_explosion_light_01",{"ref":106},"missile_guided_muzzle",{"system":108},"missile_guided",{"resilience":110},0.81,{"inertia":112,"drag":114,"mass":119},{"pitch":113,"yaw":113,"roll":113},0.258,{"forward":115,"reverse":116,"horizontal":117,"vertical":117,"pitch":118,"yaw":118,"roll":118},0.058,0.231,0.414,0.122,0.289,[121],{"macro":122,"ref":81,"resolved":125},{"ref":123,"connection":124},"engine_missile_guided_mk1_macro","ship",{"class":126,"name":123,"alias":-1,"component":127,"properties":134,"connections":155,"xmlSourceFile":156,"duplicates":157},"engine",{"class":126,"name":128,"alias":-1,"source":-1,"connections":129,"xmlSourceFile":132,"duplicates":133},"generic_engine",[130],{"name":124,"tags":131,"optional":13},"component engine standard","/assets/props/engines/generic_engine.xml",[],{"identification":135,"thrust":137,"angular":18,"hull":142,"hack":143,"effects":145,"sounds":148,"throttle":151,"areadamage":153},{"hidden":16,"mk":16,"type":136},"enginetypes",{"forward":138,"reverse":13,"strafe":139,"pitch":140,"yaw":140,"roll":141},57.887,5,158.285,218.452,{"integrated":16},{"hackable":144},true,{"boosting":146},{"ref":147},"boostfx_engine_player_01",{"highwayambient":149},{"ref":150},"engineambient_highway",{"increaserate":100,"decreaserate":152},3,{"value":154},200,[],"/assets/props/engines/macros/engine_missile_guided_mk1_macro.xml",[],"/assets/props/weaponsystems/missile/macros/missile_heatseeker_light_mk1_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
