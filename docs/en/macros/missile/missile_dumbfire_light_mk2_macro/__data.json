As a non-guided weapon, it does not possess the means to compensate for changes in the target's trajectory. While use against agile targets is therefore not advised, when used against slower targets the Wasp allows pilots to punch significantly above their weight without having to invest in more expensive missile-based weapons.\\n\\nDeployed from either a Mk1 or Mk2 standard launcher, a gas-driven piston ejects the missile from the launch tube, after which the thruster engages once safe separation is confirmed. This combination provides enhanced safety, prevents accidental burn on a jammed weapon, and significantly reduces maintenance overheads. The Light Dumbfire missile features a simple impact fuse, which triggers the warhead upon confirmed impact with any object, and an additional fallback timer. The timer is a solution to the problem that any projectile fired into space will eventually make contact and cause significant damage to whatever it impacts with. Upon reaching the specified time after launch, if the target has not already been hit, the weapon will self-detonate, leaving behind harmless microparticles as its only debris.\\n\\nThe Light Dumbfire Mk2 is the next step up from the Mk1. The increase in performance over the cheaper version can make the difference between victory and emergency ejection.","missiletypes",{"value":16},{"amount":16,"barrelamount":16,"lifetime":96,"range":97,"guided":13,"icon":98,"tags":99},6,8000,"hud_ms_dumbfire_light_mk2","dumbfire",{"value":101},1200,{"time":103},1.5,{"max":16},{"explosion":106,"launch":108},{"ref":107},"missile_explosion_light_01",{"ref":109},"missile_dumbfire_muzzle",{"system":111},"missile_dumbfire",{"resilience":16},{"inertia":114,"drag":116,"mass":121},{"pitch":115,"yaw":115,"roll":115},0.467,{"forward":117,"reverse":118,"horizontal":119,"vertical":119,"pitch":120,"yaw":120,"roll":120},0.049,0.194,0.349,0.221,0.243,[123],{"macro":124,"ref":84,"resolved":127},{"ref":125,"connection":126},"engine_missile_dumbfire_mk1_macro","ship",{"class":128,"name":125,"component":129,"properties":136,"connections":165,"xmlSourceFile":166,"duplicates":167},"engine",{"class":128,"name":130,"connections":131,"xmlSourceFile":134,"duplicates":135},"generic_engine",[132],{"name":126,"tags":133,"optional":13},"component engine standard","/assets/props/engines/generic_engine.xml",[],{"identification":137,"thrust":140,"angular":18,"hull":142,"hack":143,"effects":144,"explosioneffect":155,"sounds":157,"throttle":160,"areadamage":163},{"hidden":16,"mk":16,"type":138,"surfaceelement":139},"enginetypes",true,{"forward":141,"reverse":13,"strafe":13,"pitch":13,"yaw":13,"roll":13},57.887,{"integrated":16},{"hackable":139},{"boosting":145,"explosion":147,"sefx_damage_medium":149,"sefx_damage_high":151,"sefx_damage_low":153},{"ref":146},"boostfx_engine_player_01",{"ref":148},"surfacemodule_explosion_generator",{"ref":150},"surfacemodule_engine_damage_m_medium",{"ref":152},"surfacemodule_engine_damage_m_high",{"ref":154},"surfacemodule_damage_m_low",{"strength":156},2001,{"highwayambient":158},{"ref":159},"engineambient_highway",{"increaserate":161,"decreaserate":162},2,3,{"value":164},200,[],"/assets/props/engines/macros/engine_missile_dumbfire_mk1_macro.xml",[],"/assets/props/weaponsystems/missile/macros/missile_dumbfire_light_mk2_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
