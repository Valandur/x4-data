While undergoing power and stability testing, the weapon was fixed in a rig while the rocket motor was fired. The research team found that, at certain settings, the weapon emitted a sound wave that bore an eerie resemblance to the screams of the Banshee, a Terran mythical creature. This issue was eventually tracked down to an improperly configured pressure valve, but by the time a fix had been issued, the name had stuck.\\n\\nCompared to the Light Guided missiles, the Banshee is significantly slower but carries an absolutely devastating punch. In small salvoes, this is a good weapon to install on a fighter intended to counter heavier corvettes, and potentially even frigates, where the inherent agility advantage of the fighter can help offset the somewhat sluggish nature of this weapon. An upgraded weapon-to-ship data link not only improves the chances of first time contact, but also allows the missile to come around for multiple passes in the event of failure to connect on the first attempt. However, the weapon can be very susceptible to even basic heat-based decoys.","missiletypes",{"value":16},{"amount":16,"barrelamount":16,"lifetime":95,"range":96,"guided":16,"icon":97,"retarget":13,"tags":98},43.2,6000,"hud_ms_guided_heavy_mk1","guided",{"value":100},3520,{"time":102},6,{"max":104},3,{"explosion":106,"launch":108},{"ref":107},"missile_explosion_heavy_01",{"ref":109},"missile_guided_muzzle",{"time":104,"range":111,"angle":112},5500,12.5,{"system":114},"missile_guided",{"resilience":116},0.977,{"inertia":118,"drag":120,"mass":125},{"pitch":119,"yaw":119,"roll":119},1.807,{"forward":121,"reverse":122,"horizontal":123,"vertical":123,"pitch":124,"yaw":124,"roll":124},0.303,1.211,2.173,0.857,1.514,[127],{"macro":128,"ref":83,"resolved":131},{"ref":129,"connection":130},"engine_missile_guided_mk1_macro","ship",{"class":132,"name":129,"component":133,"properties":140,"connections":171,"xmlSourceFile":172,"duplicates":173},"engine",{"class":132,"name":134,"connections":135,"xmlSourceFile":138,"duplicates":139},"generic_engine",[136],{"name":130,"tags":137,"optional":13},"component engine standard","/assets/props/engines/generic_engine.xml",[],{"identification":141,"thrust":144,"angular":18,"hull":149,"hack":150,"effects":151,"explosioneffect":162,"sounds":164,"throttle":167,"areadamage":169},{"hidden":16,"mk":16,"type":142,"surfaceelement":143},"enginetypes",true,{"forward":145,"reverse":13,"strafe":146,"pitch":147,"yaw":147,"roll":148},57.887,5,158.285,218.452,{"integrated":16},{"hackable":143},{"boosting":152,"explosion":154,"sefx_damage_medium":156,"sefx_damage_high":158,"sefx_damage_low":160},{"ref":153},"boostfx_engine_player_01",{"ref":155},"surfacemodule_explosion_generator",{"ref":157},"surfacemodule_engine_damage_m_medium",{"ref":159},"surfacemodule_engine_damage_m_high",{"ref":161},"surfacemodule_damage_m_low",{"strength":163},2001,{"highwayambient":165},{"ref":166},"engineambient_highway",{"increaserate":168,"decreaserate":104},2,{"value":170},200,[],"/assets/props/engines/macros/engine_missile_guided_mk1_macro.xml",[],"/assets/props/weaponsystems/missile/macros/missile_guided_heavy_mk1_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
