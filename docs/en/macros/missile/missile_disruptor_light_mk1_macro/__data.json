It is likely that the weapon was reverse engineered from the Hamstring EMP-system. While the Hamstring is a non-harmful weapon that causes no lasting damage to the target and leaves the crews unharmed, the Disruptor missile has no such limitations. Using a modified copy of the Hamstring's Peregrine engine, it accelerates to a brisk pace in pursuit of its target. When the missile gets close enough to its target, it brutally attacks, not just with an electromagnetic pulse discharge, but also by allowing its reactor to go critical and subsequently detonate. The electromagnetic pulse is blasted into the target vessel moments before a violent explosion wreaks havoc on its control and guidance systems. This level of interference is enough to trick a target vessel's security protocols into triggering emergency shutdowns of their own propulsion systems, leaving them effectively immobilised for roughly the duration of a short system scan and reboot. Like the Hamstring, the extreme speeds provided by the Peregrine engine system mean that the Disruptor missile can be a difficult to control.","missiletypes",{"value":16},{"amount":16,"barrelamount":16,"lifetime":90,"range":91,"influencelist":92,"guided":16,"icon":93,"retarget":13,"tags":94},15,5000,"disruptor_missile","hud_ms_disruptor_mk1","guided",{"value":96},896,{"time":98},10,{"max":16},{"explosion":101,"launch":103},{"ref":102},"disruptor_impact",{"ref":104},"missile_guided_muzzle",{"time":106,"range":91},3,{"minlevel":90},{"system":109},"missile_guided",{"resilience":111},0.8,{"inertia":113,"drag":114,"mass":120},{"pitch":111,"yaw":16,"roll":111},{"forward":115,"reverse":116,"horizontal":117,"vertical":118,"pitch":117,"yaw":119,"roll":118},0.06,0.25,0.5,0.4,0.6,1.2,[122],{"macro":123,"ref":78,"resolved":126},{"ref":124,"connection":125},"engine_missile_guided_mk1_macro","ship",{"class":127,"name":124,"alias":-1,"component":128,"properties":135,"connections":156,"xmlSourceFile":157,"duplicates":158},"engine",{"class":127,"name":129,"alias":-1,"source":-1,"connections":130,"xmlSourceFile":133,"duplicates":134},"generic_engine",[131],{"name":125,"tags":132,"optional":13},"component engine standard","/assets/props/engines/generic_engine.xml",[],{"identification":136,"thrust":138,"angular":18,"hull":143,"hack":144,"effects":146,"sounds":149,"throttle":152,"areadamage":154},{"hidden":16,"mk":16,"type":137},"enginetypes",{"forward":139,"reverse":13,"strafe":140,"pitch":141,"yaw":141,"roll":142},57.887,5,158.285,218.452,{"integrated":16},{"hackable":145},true,{"boosting":147},{"ref":148},"boostfx_engine_player_01",{"highwayambient":150},{"ref":151},"engineambient_highway",{"increaserate":153,"decreaserate":106},2,{"value":155},200,[],"/assets/props/engines/macros/engine_missile_guided_mk1_macro.xml",[],"/ego_dlc_split/assets/props/weaponsystems/missile/macros/missile_disruptor_light_mk1_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
