This necessitated highly advanced friend-foe identification capabilities, as well as a tightly restrained explosive effector, in order to avoid accidentally inflicting damage on friendly ships near the intended target. ATF stopped development in favour of more promising weapon systems and the technology remained dormant for many decades before research was continued by an intrepid Argon scientist, who obtained the schematics from an undercover agent.\\n\\nThe Light Smart missile relies on a special chemical mixture for its burn that gives a markedly reduced thermal signature. This, combined with the smokeless launch of the magnetic induction system, means that its launch can be very difficult to detect by the intended target, especially if the pilot is clever enough to conceal the launch with an appropriate manoeuvre. The Light Smart missile has a very small warhead; however, once released, its long, narrow dart is capable of penetrating through the forms of most Xenon ships dealing massive damage to their internals.","missiletypes",{"value":16},{"amount":16,"barrelamount":16,"lifetime":93,"range":94,"guided":16,"icon":95,"retarget":16,"tags":96},10,4000,"hud_ms_smart_heavy_mk1","guided",{"value":98},657,{"time":100},2,{"max":16},{"explosion":103,"launch":105},{"ref":104},"missile_explosion_light_01",{"ref":106},"missile_guided_muzzle",{"system":108},"missile_guided",{"resilience":16},{"inertia":111,"drag":113,"mass":118},{"pitch":112,"yaw":112,"roll":112},0.271,{"forward":114,"reverse":115,"horizontal":116,"vertical":116,"pitch":117,"yaw":117,"roll":117},0.074,0.296,0.53,0.128,0.37,[120],{"macro":121,"ref":81,"resolved":124},{"ref":122,"connection":123},"engine_missile_guided_mk1_macro","ship",{"class":125,"name":122,"alias":-1,"component":126,"properties":133,"connections":154,"xmlSourceFile":155,"duplicates":156},"engine",{"class":125,"name":127,"alias":-1,"source":-1,"connections":128,"xmlSourceFile":131,"duplicates":132},"generic_engine",[129],{"name":123,"tags":130,"optional":13},"component engine standard","/assets/props/engines/generic_engine.xml",[],{"identification":134,"thrust":136,"angular":18,"hull":141,"hack":142,"effects":144,"sounds":147,"throttle":150,"areadamage":152},{"hidden":16,"mk":16,"type":135},"enginetypes",{"forward":137,"reverse":13,"strafe":138,"pitch":139,"yaw":139,"roll":140},57.887,5,158.285,218.452,{"integrated":16},{"hackable":143},true,{"boosting":145},{"ref":146},"boostfx_engine_player_01",{"highwayambient":148},{"ref":149},"engineambient_highway",{"increaserate":100,"decreaserate":151},3,{"value":153},200,[],"/assets/props/engines/macros/engine_missile_guided_mk1_macro.xml",[],"/assets/props/weaponsystems/missile/macros/missile_smart_light_mk1_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
