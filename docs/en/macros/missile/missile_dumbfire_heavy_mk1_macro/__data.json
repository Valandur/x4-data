A compromise on thruster performance allows for a significantly enhanced warhead.\\n\\nDeployed from either a Mk1 or Mk2 standard launcher, a gas-driven piston ejects the missile from the launch tube, after which the thruster engages once safe separation is confirmed. This combination provides enhanced safety, prevents accidental burn on a jammed weapon, and significantly reduces maintenance overheads.\\n\\nLike its cheaper and less powerful counterpart, the missile utilises a simple impact fuse and an additional fallback timer. However, the Heavy Dumbfire missile features two separate warhead components that sit in tandem directly behind the impact fuse. When triggered, the precursor warhead immediately detonates, sending a superheated dart capable of piercing the outer hull of most ships. Microseconds after the precursor is fired, the much larger main charge triggers a conventional high explosive, causing potentially catastrophic damage to smaller vessels and significant damage to larger ones. If the weapon fails to impact the intended target, it will continue in a straight line until the onboard timer expires, at which point it will safely self-destruct.","missiletypes",{"value":16},{"amount":16,"barrelamount":16,"lifetime":96,"range":97,"guided":13,"icon":98,"tags":99},25.92,9000,"hud_ms_dumbfire_heavy_mk1","dumbfire",{"value":101},3960,{"time":103},4.5,{"max":105},2,{"explosion":107,"launch":109},{"ref":108},"missile_explosion_medium_01",{"ref":110},"missile_dumbfire_muzzle",{"system":112},"missile_dumbfire",{"resilience":16},{"inertia":115,"drag":117,"mass":122},{"pitch":116,"yaw":116,"roll":116},1.519,{"forward":118,"reverse":119,"horizontal":120,"vertical":120,"pitch":121,"yaw":121,"roll":121},0.248,0.993,1.782,0.721,1.241,[124],{"macro":125,"ref":84,"resolved":128},{"ref":126,"connection":127},"engine_missile_dumbfire_mk1_macro","ship",{"class":129,"name":126,"alias":-1,"component":130,"properties":137,"connections":155,"xmlSourceFile":156,"duplicates":157},"engine",{"class":129,"name":131,"alias":-1,"source":-1,"connections":132,"xmlSourceFile":135,"duplicates":136},"generic_engine",[133],{"name":127,"tags":134,"optional":13},"component engine standard","/assets/props/engines/generic_engine.xml",[],{"identification":138,"thrust":140,"angular":18,"hull":142,"hack":143,"effects":145,"sounds":148,"throttle":151,"areadamage":153},{"hidden":16,"mk":16,"type":139},"enginetypes",{"forward":141,"reverse":13,"strafe":13,"pitch":13,"yaw":13,"roll":13},57.887,{"integrated":16},{"hackable":144},true,{"boosting":146},{"ref":147},"boostfx_engine_player_01",{"highwayambient":149},{"ref":150},"engineambient_highway",{"increaserate":105,"decreaserate":152},3,{"value":154},200,[],"/assets/props/engines/macros/engine_missile_dumbfire_mk1_macro.xml",[],"/assets/props/weaponsystems/missile/macros/missile_dumbfire_heavy_mk1_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
