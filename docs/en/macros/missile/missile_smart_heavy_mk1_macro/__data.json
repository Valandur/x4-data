Where the Light Smart missile would be used against the agile fighters and heavy fighters of the Xenon, the Heavy Smart missile was meant for heavy fighters and light to medium corvette-sized ships. Like its smaller counterpart, the Heavy Smart missile also required the same focus on friend-foe discrimination capability, but its warhead would be scaled up in order to more effectively handle the larger types of targets it was intended for use against. Unfortunately, the weapon system suffered the same fate as the Light Smart missile; the ATF stopped development in favour of more promising weapon systems and the technology remained dormant for many decades before research was continued by an intrepid Argon scientist, who obtained the schematics from an undercover agent.","missiletypes",{"value":16},{"amount":16,"barrelamount":16,"lifetime":93,"range":94,"guided":16,"icon":95,"retarget":16,"tags":96},43.2,5500,"hud_ms_smart_heavy_mk1","guided",{"value":98},3378,{"time":100},6,{"max":102},3,{"explosion":104,"launch":106},{"ref":105},"missile_explosion_medium_01",{"ref":107},"missile_guided_muzzle",{"system":109},"missile_guided",{"resilience":16},{"inertia":112,"drag":114,"mass":119},{"pitch":113,"yaw":113,"roll":113},2.003,{"forward":115,"reverse":116,"horizontal":117,"vertical":117,"pitch":118,"yaw":118,"roll":118},0.34,1.36,2.44,0.95,1.7,[121],{"macro":122,"ref":81,"resolved":125},{"ref":123,"connection":124},"engine_missile_guided_mk1_macro","ship",{"class":126,"name":123,"component":127,"properties":134,"connections":165,"xmlSourceFile":166,"duplicates":167},"engine",{"class":126,"name":128,"connections":129,"xmlSourceFile":132,"duplicates":133},"generic_engine",[130],{"name":124,"tags":131,"optional":13},"component engine standard","/assets/props/engines/generic_engine.xml",[],{"identification":135,"thrust":138,"angular":18,"hull":143,"hack":144,"effects":145,"explosioneffect":156,"sounds":158,"throttle":161,"areadamage":163},{"hidden":16,"mk":16,"type":136,"surfaceelement":137},"enginetypes",true,{"forward":139,"reverse":13,"strafe":140,"pitch":141,"yaw":141,"roll":142},57.887,5,158.285,218.452,{"integrated":16},{"hackable":137},{"boosting":146,"explosion":148,"sefx_damage_medium":150,"sefx_damage_high":152,"sefx_damage_low":154},{"ref":147},"boostfx_engine_player_01",{"ref":149},"surfacemodule_explosion_generator",{"ref":151},"surfacemodule_engine_damage_m_medium",{"ref":153},"surfacemodule_engine_damage_m_high",{"ref":155},"surfacemodule_damage_m_low",{"strength":157},2001,{"highwayambient":159},{"ref":160},"engineambient_highway",{"increaserate":162,"decreaserate":102},2,{"value":164},200,[],"/assets/props/engines/macros/engine_missile_guided_mk1_macro.xml",[],"/assets/props/weaponsystems/missile/macros/missile_smart_heavy_mk1_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
