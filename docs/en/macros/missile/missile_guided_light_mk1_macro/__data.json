It is a relatively inexpensive system compared to its more capable counterparts. Cheap, fairly easy to produce, and with very little in the way of training required for its use, this is a great way to give a new pilot a significant advantage in combat.\\n\\nThe guidance system is a simplistic one-way data link that enables the launch platform to continuously feed the missile updated information on its position relative to that of its intended target. Unfortunately, it is exceptionally easy to jam and, combined with the use of a very rudimentary thermal imaging sensor, it is very poorly suited to engaging agile targets with capable missile countermeasures on board. In keeping with the other cost-saving measures of the weapon, the Light Guided Mk1 has only a very basic ability to penetrate the armoured hulls of warships. However, if a breach does occur, the fact that the charge was originally designed for mining in deep space means it retains a high degree of efficiency.","missiletypes",{"value":16},{"amount":16,"barrelamount":16,"lifetime":95,"range":96,"guided":16,"icon":97,"retarget":13,"tags":98},10,4500,"hud_ms_guided_light_mk1","guided",{"value":100},685,{"time":102},2,{"max":16},{"explosion":105,"launch":107},{"ref":106},"missile_explosion_light_01",{"ref":108},"missile_guided_muzzle",{"time":102,"range":96},{"minlevel":111},15,{"system":113},"missile_guided",{"resilience":115},0.977,{"inertia":117,"drag":119,"mass":124},{"pitch":118,"yaw":118,"roll":118},0.264,{"forward":120,"reverse":121,"horizontal":122,"vertical":122,"pitch":123,"yaw":123,"roll":123},0.066,0.263,0.472,0.125,0.329,[126],{"macro":127,"ref":83,"resolved":130},{"ref":128,"connection":129},"engine_missile_guided_mk1_macro","ship",{"class":131,"name":128,"component":132,"properties":139,"connections":170,"xmlSourceFile":171,"duplicates":172},"engine",{"class":131,"name":133,"connections":134,"xmlSourceFile":137,"duplicates":138},"generic_engine",[135],{"name":129,"tags":136,"optional":13},"component engine standard","/assets/props/engines/generic_engine.xml",[],{"identification":140,"thrust":143,"angular":18,"hull":148,"hack":149,"effects":150,"explosioneffect":161,"sounds":163,"throttle":166,"areadamage":168},{"hidden":16,"mk":16,"type":141,"surfaceelement":142},"enginetypes",true,{"forward":144,"reverse":13,"strafe":145,"pitch":146,"yaw":146,"roll":147},57.887,5,158.285,218.452,{"integrated":16},{"hackable":142},{"boosting":151,"explosion":153,"sefx_damage_medium":155,"sefx_damage_high":157,"sefx_damage_low":159},{"ref":152},"boostfx_engine_player_01",{"ref":154},"surfacemodule_explosion_generator",{"ref":156},"surfacemodule_engine_damage_m_medium",{"ref":158},"surfacemodule_engine_damage_m_high",{"ref":160},"surfacemodule_damage_m_low",{"strength":162},2001,{"highwayambient":164},{"ref":165},"engineambient_highway",{"increaserate":102,"decreaserate":167},3,{"value":169},200,[],"/assets/props/engines/macros/engine_missile_guided_mk1_macro.xml",[],"/assets/props/weaponsystems/missile/macros/missile_guided_light_mk1_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
