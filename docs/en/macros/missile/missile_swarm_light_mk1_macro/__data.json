A single container missile is launched from a standardised universal launcher tube. The container is really only there to ensure compatibility with standardised tube dimensions, and is discarded immediately after clearing the launch-tube. As the four-part outer shell peels away, the Light Swarm missile reveals its many, viciously fanged heads in the form of several smaller, independently operating missiles that streak towards the target.\\n\\nAn unfortunate compromise born of the smaller form factor of these sub-missiles, is naturally that their warheads and guidance sections are not nearly as capable as those of a full-sized weapon. However, where a full-sized weapon would present a significantly easier interception task for the defensive gun and missile systems on a target vessel, the multiple smaller weapons complicate this, both by increasing the saturation level through sheer numbers but also by being smaller and effectively a harder target to hit. This requires guns to stay longer on target, and defensive missile banks to expend many more shorts to avert an impact.","missiletypes",{"value":16},{"amount":95,"barrelamount":16,"lifetime":96,"range":97,"swarm":16,"guided":16,"icon":98,"retarget":16,"tags":99},8,10,4000,"hud_ms_swarm_light_mk1","guided",{"value":101},134,{"time":103},4,{"max":16},{"explosion":106,"launch":108},{"ref":107},"missile_explosion_light_01",{"ref":109},"missile_guided_muzzle",{"system":111},"missile_guided",{"resilience":113},0.86,{"inertia":115,"drag":117,"mass":121},{"pitch":116,"yaw":116,"roll":116},0.275,{"forward":118,"reverse":119,"horizontal":120,"vertical":120,"pitch":116,"yaw":116,"roll":116},0.07,0.28,0.591,0.349,[123],{"macro":124,"ref":83,"resolved":127},{"ref":125,"connection":126},"engine_missile_swarm_mk1_macro","ship",{"class":128,"name":125,"alias":-1,"component":129,"properties":136,"connections":158,"xmlSourceFile":159,"duplicates":160},"engine",{"class":128,"name":130,"alias":-1,"source":-1,"connections":131,"xmlSourceFile":134,"duplicates":135},"generic_engine",[132],{"name":126,"tags":133,"optional":13},"component engine standard","/assets/props/engines/generic_engine.xml",[],{"identification":137,"thrust":139,"angular":18,"hull":144,"hack":145,"effects":147,"sounds":150,"throttle":153,"areadamage":156},{"hidden":16,"mk":16,"type":138},"enginetypes",{"forward":140,"reverse":13,"strafe":141,"pitch":142,"yaw":142,"roll":143},57.887,8.167,170.318,218.452,{"integrated":16},{"hackable":146},true,{"boosting":148},{"ref":149},"boostfx_engine_player_01",{"highwayambient":151},{"ref":152},"engineambient_highway",{"increaserate":154,"decreaserate":155},2,3,{"value":157},200,[],"/assets/props/engines/macros/engine_missile_swarm_mk1_macro.xml",[],"/assets/props/weaponsystems/missile/macros/missile_swarm_light_mk1_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
