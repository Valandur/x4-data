Like its smaller counterpart, the Heavy Swarm missile uses a two-stage solution to achieve this. A larger primary stage consists of an external shell that carries multiple, smaller missiles internally. The outer shell ensures compliance with standardised launchers, and the internally carried sub-missiles are released just a few seconds after launch. At that point, they disperse and follow an infra-red spectrum guidance laser from the launching ship to the intended target. The use of the laser makes the system somewhat cheaper, which helps offset the cost of several guidance sections, but also makes the weapon susceptible to infra-red decoys such as flares.\\n\\nThe sub-missiles are fitted with fairly powerful high-explosive warheads behind a teladianium disc. When triggered, the teladianium forms into a shape somewhat like a dart. This dart penetrates into the target where it fractures into large, devastating shards of almost molten metal, causing tremendous damage.","missiletypes",{"value":16},{"amount":95,"barrelamount":16,"lifetime":96,"range":97,"swarm":16,"guided":16,"icon":98,"retarget":16,"tags":99},8,43.2,5500,"hud_ms_swarm_heavy_mk1","guided",{"value":101},690,{"time":103},12,{"max":105},3,{"explosion":107,"launch":109},{"ref":108},"missile_explosion_medium_01",{"ref":110},"missile_guided_muzzle",{"system":112},"missile_guided",{"resilience":114},0.975,{"inertia":116,"drag":118,"mass":122},{"pitch":117,"yaw":117,"roll":117},0.904,{"forward":119,"reverse":120,"horizontal":121,"vertical":121,"pitch":117,"yaw":117,"roll":117},0.321,1.286,2.716,1.607,[124],{"macro":125,"ref":83,"resolved":128},{"ref":126,"connection":127},"engine_missile_swarm_mk1_macro","ship",{"class":129,"name":126,"component":130,"properties":137,"connections":168,"xmlSourceFile":169,"duplicates":170},"engine",{"class":129,"name":131,"connections":132,"xmlSourceFile":135,"duplicates":136},"generic_engine",[133],{"name":127,"tags":134,"optional":13},"component engine standard","/assets/props/engines/generic_engine.xml",[],{"identification":138,"thrust":141,"angular":18,"hull":146,"hack":147,"effects":148,"explosioneffect":159,"sounds":161,"throttle":164,"areadamage":166},{"hidden":16,"mk":16,"type":139,"surfaceelement":140},"enginetypes",true,{"forward":142,"reverse":13,"strafe":143,"pitch":144,"yaw":144,"roll":145},57.887,8.167,170.318,218.452,{"integrated":16},{"hackable":140},{"boosting":149,"explosion":151,"sefx_damage_medium":153,"sefx_damage_high":155,"sefx_damage_low":157},{"ref":150},"boostfx_engine_player_01",{"ref":152},"surfacemodule_explosion_generator",{"ref":154},"surfacemodule_engine_damage_m_medium",{"ref":156},"surfacemodule_engine_damage_m_high",{"ref":158},"surfacemodule_damage_m_low",{"strength":160},2001,{"highwayambient":162},{"ref":163},"engineambient_highway",{"increaserate":165,"decreaserate":105},2,{"value":167},200,[],"/assets/props/engines/macros/engine_missile_swarm_mk1_macro.xml",[],"/assets/props/weaponsystems/missile/macros/missile_swarm_heavy_mk1_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
