With a powerful matter/antimatter reaction engine, and a highly specialised warhead, this weapon can reach top speeds well in excess of that of common ship travel drives. When it reaches its target, it sheds the protective outer shell and exposes an elaborate antenna array, which it uses to accurately aim and discharge a powerful electromagnetic pulse. The effect of this pulse is a prompt shutdown of the target ship's travel drive, which makes the law enforcement vessel's task of catching up significantly easier. Using a combination of extremely accurate radar, and computer-based prediction algorithms carried out before launch, the weapon works by predicting an impact point from a straight line approach rather than attempting to chase down the target via curves and turns like most other weapons. It is worth noting that, with the extreme speeds provided by the Peregrine engine system, the Hamstring can be a difficult beast to control.","missiletypes",{"value":16},{"amount":16,"barrelamount":16,"lifetime":93,"range":94,"influencelist":95,"guided":16,"icon":96,"retarget":13,"tags":97},10,20000,"emp_missile","hud_ms_emp_mk1","guided",{"value":13},{"time":100},22.5,{"max":16},{"explosion":103,"launch":105},{"ref":104},"missile_explosion_emp",{"ref":106},"missile_guided_muzzle",{"time":108,"range":94},2,{"minlevel":110},15,{"system":112},"missile_guided",{"resilience":114},0.951,{"inertia":116,"drag":118,"mass":122},{"pitch":117,"yaw":117,"roll":117},0.254,{"forward":119,"reverse":120,"horizontal":121,"vertical":121,"pitch":117,"yaw":117,"roll":117},0.001,0.247,0.522,0.309,[124],{"macro":125,"ref":81,"resolved":128},{"ref":126,"connection":127},"engine_missile_guided_mk1_macro","ship",{"class":129,"name":126,"component":130,"properties":137,"connections":168,"xmlSourceFile":169,"duplicates":170},"engine",{"class":129,"name":131,"connections":132,"xmlSourceFile":135,"duplicates":136},"generic_engine",[133],{"name":127,"tags":134,"optional":13},"component engine standard","/assets/props/engines/generic_engine.xml",[],{"identification":138,"thrust":141,"angular":18,"hull":146,"hack":147,"effects":148,"explosioneffect":159,"sounds":161,"throttle":164,"areadamage":166},{"hidden":16,"mk":16,"type":139,"surfaceelement":140},"enginetypes",true,{"forward":142,"reverse":13,"strafe":143,"pitch":144,"yaw":144,"roll":145},57.887,5,158.285,218.452,{"integrated":16},{"hackable":140},{"boosting":149,"explosion":151,"sefx_damage_medium":153,"sefx_damage_high":155,"sefx_damage_low":157},{"ref":150},"boostfx_engine_player_01",{"ref":152},"surfacemodule_explosion_generator",{"ref":154},"surfacemodule_engine_damage_m_medium",{"ref":156},"surfacemodule_engine_damage_m_high",{"ref":158},"surfacemodule_damage_m_low",{"strength":160},2001,{"highwayambient":162},{"ref":163},"engineambient_highway",{"increaserate":108,"decreaserate":165},3,{"value":167},200,[],"/assets/props/engines/macros/engine_missile_guided_mk1_macro.xml",[],"/assets/props/weaponsystems/missile/macros/missile_emp_mk1_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
