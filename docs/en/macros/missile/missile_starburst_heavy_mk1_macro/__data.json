So hard in fact, that by some measures, it carries arguably the most powerful warhead available for any missile weapon shy of a torpedo-class munition. The incredible destructive power of the weapon, along with its classification, has been the source of no small number of legal disputes between the Split, seeking to keep it as a missile for export purposes, and certain non-Split wishing to have it reclassified as a Torpedo for their own benefit.\\n\\nThe Starburst uses a special kind of fuel, in the form of a continuous rod that extends through almost the entire length of the weapon. This rod serves as both fuel for the engine, and as the source of its destructive potential. The rate of combustion is kept under control by spraying the fuel-rod with a dampener-agent, without which the burn-rate spirals out of control much in the same way as a star going supernova, albeit on a much smaller scale.","missiletypes",{"value":16},{"amount":16,"barrelamount":16,"lifetime":90,"range":91,"guided":16,"icon":92,"retarget":13,"tags":93},43.2,6000,"hud_ms_starburst_heavy_mk1","guided",{"value":95},3800,{"time":97},8,{"max":99},3,{"explosion":101,"launch":103},{"ref":102},"missile_explosion_heavy_01",{"ref":104},"missile_guided_muzzle",{"time":99,"range":106,"angle":107},5500,10,{"minlevel":109},15,{"system":111},"missile_guided",{"resilience":113},0.87,{"inertia":115,"drag":117,"mass":99},{"pitch":116,"yaw":116,"roll":116},1.8,{"forward":118,"reverse":119,"horizontal":120,"vertical":120,"pitch":121,"yaw":121,"roll":121},0.3,1.2,2.1,0.85,[123],{"macro":124,"ref":78,"resolved":127},{"ref":125,"connection":126},"engine_missile_guided_mk1_macro","ship",{"class":128,"name":125,"alias":-1,"component":129,"properties":136,"connections":157,"xmlSourceFile":158,"duplicates":159},"engine",{"class":128,"name":130,"alias":-1,"source":-1,"connections":131,"xmlSourceFile":134,"duplicates":135},"generic_engine",[132],{"name":126,"tags":133,"optional":13},"component engine standard","/assets/props/engines/generic_engine.xml",[],{"identification":137,"thrust":139,"angular":18,"hull":144,"hack":145,"effects":147,"sounds":150,"throttle":153,"areadamage":155},{"hidden":16,"mk":16,"type":138},"enginetypes",{"forward":140,"reverse":13,"strafe":141,"pitch":142,"yaw":142,"roll":143},57.887,5,158.285,218.452,{"integrated":16},{"hackable":146},true,{"boosting":148},{"ref":149},"boostfx_engine_player_01",{"highwayambient":151},{"ref":152},"engineambient_highway",{"increaserate":154,"decreaserate":99},2,{"value":156},200,[],"/assets/props/engines/macros/engine_missile_guided_mk1_macro.xml",[],"/ego_dlc_split/assets/props/weaponsystems/missile/macros/missile_starburst_heavy_mk1_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
