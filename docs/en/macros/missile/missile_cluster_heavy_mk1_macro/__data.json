While the damage caused to each individual target is naturally significantly less than could be achieved with a unitary charge, cluster-munitions, packing sufficiently powerful sub-munitions, can provide a pilot with the means to quickly disable a hostile target by taking out key components.\\n\\nLike the dumbfire-type munitions, the cluster-based weapon does not possess the means to compensate for changes in the target's trajectory. Target data from the ship's onboard computer systems is used to program a timer moments before the weapon's launch. Once the timer reaches its end, ideally moments before the missile impacts, a plethora of smart mini-bombs or \"bomblets\" are dispersed around the target area. These feature fairly advanced homing software to enable them to seek out the more vulnerable parts of the exposed systems of an enemy combatant.\\n\\nThe Heavy Cluster weapon represents a considerable step up in terms of destructive capability, while sacrificing thrust-to-weight ratio, compared to its smaller counterpart. An increase in the number and size of bomblets, along with a new and improved explosive compound, results in significantly increased effectiveness.","missiletypes",{"value":16},{"amount":16,"barrelamount":16,"lifetime":93,"range":94,"distribute":16,"guided":13,"icon":95,"tags":96},129.6,7000,"hud_ms_cluster_heavy_mk1","dumbfire",{"value":98},12141,{"time":100},45,{"max":102},2,{"explosion":104,"launch":106},{"ref":105},"missile_explosion_medium_01",{"ref":107},"missile_dumbfire_muzzle",{"macro":109},"missile_swarm_heavy_mk1_macro",{"system":111},"missile_dumbfire",{"resilience":16},{"inertia":114,"drag":116,"mass":119},{"pitch":115,"yaw":115,"roll":115},76.915,{"forward":117,"reverse":118,"horizontal":119,"vertical":119,"pitch":120,"yaw":120,"roll":120},1.607,6.427,38.258,19.229,[122],{"macro":123,"ref":81,"resolved":126},{"ref":124,"connection":125},"engine_missile_dumbfire_mk1_macro","ship",{"class":127,"name":124,"alias":-1,"component":128,"properties":135,"connections":153,"xmlSourceFile":154,"duplicates":155},"engine",{"class":127,"name":129,"alias":-1,"source":-1,"connections":130,"xmlSourceFile":133,"duplicates":134},"generic_engine",[131],{"name":125,"tags":132,"optional":13},"component engine standard","/assets/props/engines/generic_engine.xml",[],{"identification":136,"thrust":138,"angular":18,"hull":140,"hack":141,"effects":143,"sounds":146,"throttle":149,"areadamage":151},{"hidden":16,"mk":16,"type":137},"enginetypes",{"forward":139,"reverse":13,"strafe":13,"pitch":13,"yaw":13,"roll":13},57.887,{"integrated":16},{"hackable":142},true,{"boosting":144},{"ref":145},"boostfx_engine_player_01",{"highwayambient":147},{"ref":148},"engineambient_highway",{"increaserate":102,"decreaserate":150},3,{"value":152},200,[],"/assets/props/engines/macros/engine_missile_dumbfire_mk1_macro.xml",[],"/assets/props/weaponsystems/missile/macros/missile_cluster_heavy_mk1_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
