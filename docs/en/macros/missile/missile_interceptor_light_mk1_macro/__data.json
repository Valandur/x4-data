This weapon system has a lot of fitting names, almost all of them indicative of some sort of protective nature, and is one of those rare cases of a truly defence-oriented weapon with an underlying idealistic background. The blueprints were distributed anonymously, and roughly at the same time, to a great many factions, in the face of an influx of Split raiding ships. While the origins of the system remain shrouded in mystery, it presents a very real and often-lauded tool today, that often sees use in defensive turrets on trade and cargo ships, as well as on defensive installations in various sectors. While the system is primarily intended to be used as a defensive, counter-missile tool, it is also quite capable of warding off potential aggressors. With a salvo-based firing solution, a ship under attack can quite quickly put out a very large quantity of defensive fire which is often enough to dissuade or destroy an opportunistic assailant.","missiletypes",{"amount":91,"barrelamount":16,"delay":16,"timediff":92,"lifetime":93,"range":94,"swarm":16,"influencelist":95,"guided":16,"icon":96,"retarget":13,"tags":97},5,0.5,30,39000,"emp_missile","hud_ms_interceptor_light_mk1","guided",{"value":99},100,{"time":101},2,{"max":16},{"explosion":104,"launch":106},{"ref":105},"missile_explosion_light_01",{"ref":107},"missile_guided_muzzle",{"time":101,"range":109},29500,{"minlevel":111},15,{"system":113},"missile_guided",{"resilience":115},0.75,{"inertia":117,"drag":119,"mass":125},{"pitch":118,"yaw":118,"roll":118},0.26,{"forward":120,"reverse":121,"horizontal":122,"vertical":123,"pitch":124,"yaw":124,"roll":124},0.0125,0.263,0.47,0.472,0.125,0.133,[127],{"macro":128,"ref":80,"resolved":131},{"ref":129,"connection":130},"engine_missile_guided_mk1_macro","ship",{"class":132,"name":129,"alias":-1,"component":133,"properties":140,"connections":160,"xmlSourceFile":161,"duplicates":162},"engine",{"class":132,"name":134,"alias":-1,"source":-1,"connections":135,"xmlSourceFile":138,"duplicates":139},"generic_engine",[136],{"name":130,"tags":137,"optional":13},"component engine standard","/assets/props/engines/generic_engine.xml",[],{"identification":141,"thrust":143,"angular":18,"hull":147,"hack":148,"effects":150,"sounds":153,"throttle":156,"areadamage":158},{"hidden":16,"mk":16,"type":142},"enginetypes",{"forward":144,"reverse":13,"strafe":91,"pitch":145,"yaw":145,"roll":146},57.887,158.285,218.452,{"integrated":16},{"hackable":149},true,{"boosting":151},{"ref":152},"boostfx_engine_player_01",{"highwayambient":154},{"ref":155},"engineambient_highway",{"increaserate":101,"decreaserate":157},3,{"value":159},200,[],"/assets/props/engines/macros/engine_missile_guided_mk1_macro.xml",[],"/ego_dlc_split/assets/props/weaponsystems/missile/macros/missile_interceptor_light_mk1_macro.xml",[]],"uses":{"params":["type","name"],"parent":1}}]}
